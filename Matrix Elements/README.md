# Matrix Elements Sum

Given a rectangular matrix of integers, your task is to return the total sum of all elements that don't fall under a zero (0).

Example:
```
1.

[[0, 2, 2, 1],
 [0, 6, 0, 0],	=> 2 + 2 + 1 + 6 => 11
 [1, 0, 4, 5]]

2.

 [[ 0,  0, 2],
  [10, 55, 0], => 2 (Everything that's under a zero becomes obsolete.)
  [40, 22, 9]] 
```
