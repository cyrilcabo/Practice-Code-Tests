Almost Increasing Sequence

Given an array of integers, determine if the elements are sorted in an increasing order. You are allowed to remove at most 1 element from the array. Output is either TRUE or FALSE.

Example:

1. almostIncreasingSequence([1,2,3,4,5]) => TRUE

2. almostIncreasingSequence([1,2,3,6,5]) => (Remove 6) => [1,2,3,5] => TRUE

3. almostIncreasingSequence([1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 5]) => (Remove 6) => [1, 2, 4, 3, 5] => FALSE
